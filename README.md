# 01-challenge

## Description

This project focused on refactoring code to make it more accessible to both users and other developers. The HTML and CSS started out with an abundance of redundancies and a lack of semantic elements. Grouping the class attributes of elements that already used the same CSS styling to one class name helped to declutter the stylesheet. I also included some styling changes that made the page more visually appealing for those using the webpage. The aspect that I most struggled with and feel needs improvement is making the webpage accessible across different media devices, such as smartphones. I will continue to work on the media query aspect.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

The webpage can be used to browse information about SEO, online reputation, and social media marketing. Each of these subjects are divided into sections which are linked in the navigation bar.
