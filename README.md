# 01-challenge

## Description

This project focused on refactoring code to make it more accessible to both users and other developers. The HTML and CSS started out with an abundance of redundancies and a lack of semantic elements. Grouping the class attributes of elements that already used the same CSS styling to one class name helped to declutter the stylesheet. I also included some styling changes that made the page more visually appealing for those using the webpage. The aspect that I most struggled with and feel could still use improvement is making the webpage accessible across different media devices, such as smartphones.
